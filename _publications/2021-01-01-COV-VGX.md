excerpt: 'The paper presents COV-VGX, an automated detection system for COVID-19 using chest X-ray images through deep learning and transfer learning approaches. It employs two classifiers: a multiclass classifier to discern among COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal cases, and a binary classifier for COVID-19 and pneumonia. Leveraging the VGG-16 model, it achieves significant accuracy and precision, demonstrating its potential as an effective tool in diagnosing COVID-19 in a clinical setting. The paper also discusses the challenges of limited COVID-19 image datasets and the importance of accurate testing to prevent disease spread.'

<b>Abstract:</b>
Coronavirus (COVID-19) has been one of the most dangerous and acute deadly diseases across the world recently. Researchers are trying to develop automated and feasible COVID-19 detection systems with the help of deep neural networks, machine learning techniques, etc. In this paper, a deep learning-based COVID-19 detection system called COV-VGX is proposed that contributes to detecting coronavirus disease automatically using chest X-ray images. The system introduces two types of classifiers, namely, a multiclass classifier that automatically predicts coronavirus, pneumonia, and normal classes and a binary classifier that predicts coronavirus and pneumonia classes. Using transfer learning, a deep CNN model is proposed to extract distinct and high-level features from X-ray images in collaboration with the pretrained model VGG-16. Despite the limitation of the COVID-19 dataset, the model is evaluated with sufficient COVID-19 images. Extensive experiments for multiclass classifier have achieved 98.91% accuracy, 97.31% precision, 99.50% recall, 98.39% F1-score, while 99.37% accuracy, 98.76% precision, 100% recall, 99.38% F1-score for binary classifier. The proposed system can contribute a lot in diagnosing COVID-19 effectively in the medical field.
