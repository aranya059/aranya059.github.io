<b>Abstract:</b>
Medical image classification has gained
tremendous attention in recent years, and Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) is the most widespread neural
network model for image classification problem. CNN is
designed to determine features adaptively through
backpropagation by applying numerous building blocks, such
as convolution layers, pooling layers, and fully connected
layers. In this paper, we mainly focused on developing a CNN
model for classifying brain tumors in T1-weighted contrast-
enhanced MRI images. The proposed system consists of two
significant steps. First, preprocess the images using different
image processing techniques and then classify the
preprocessed image using CNN. The experiment is conducted
on a dataset of 3064 images which contain three types of brain
tumor (glioma, meningioma, pituitary). We achieved a high
testing accuracy of 94.39%, average precision of 93.33% and
an average recall of 93% using our CNN model. The proposed
system exhibited satisfying accuracy on the dataset and
outperformed many of the prominent existing methods.
