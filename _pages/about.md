Hello! I'm OFM Riaz Rahman Aranya, but please call me Aranya or Riaz, whichever you prefer. I'm a PhD student in the Department of <a href="https://sciences.utsa.edu/computer-science/">Computer Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.utsa.edu">University of Texas at San Antonio</a>. I'm proudly part of the Vision & Immersive Realities Lab, where I'm under the guidance of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/kevinpdesai">Dr. Kevin Desai</a>. My academic journey is deeply intertwined with a commitment to exploring the realms of Deep Learning and AI, with a particular focus on image segmentation using deep learning techniques.

Research and Innovation
======

In the realm of academia, I am deeply engrossed in unraveling the complexities of neural networks and their capabilities to transform visual computing. My current projects involve developing cutting-edge algorithms that efficiently segment images, a crucial step towards enhancing machine perception. This research not only pushes the boundaries of what machines can visually understand but also opens up myriad applications in fields such as medical imaging, autonomous driving, and interactive media. I began my research during my junior year (third year) of undergraduate study at <a href="https://kuet.ac.bd">Khulna University of Engineering & Technology</a> under the guidance of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1OPbHxwAAAAJ&hl=en">Sunanda Das</a>. Our work titled 'Brain Tumor Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network' was published at the 1st International Conference on Advances in Science, Engineering and Robotics Technology (ICASERT) in 2019. Subsequently, I completed my thesis under the guidance of <a href="https://kuet.ac.bd/cse/sadi/index.php?pg=publication">Dr. Muhammad Sheikh Sadi</a>, focusing on 'Myocardial Infarction Detection by Analyzing ECG Signals'. After graduation, I continued my research with <a href="https://kuet.ac.bd/cse/sadi/index.php?pg=publication">Dr. Muhammad Sheikh Sadi</a> and achieved my second publication, 'COV-VGX: An Automated COVID-19 Detection System Using X-ray Images and Transfer Learning,' published in Informatics in Medicine Unlocked in 2021.

Educational Journey
======

Before embarking on my PhD journey, I honed my skills and deepened my knowledge base with a robust academic background that equipped me with the tools to tackle complex problems in the tech world. At <a href="https://kuet.ac.bd">Khulna University of Engineering & Technology</a>, where I completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering, I not only expanded my research portfolio but also engaged in collaborative projects that sharpened my abilities to innovate and lead in technology.

Beyond the Lab
======

Outside the lab, I am actively involved in community-building activities within the tech community, including workshops and seminars. These initiatives allow me to share knowledge and foster a culture of innovation and inclusivity, reflecting my belief in the transformative power of technology. I am committed to ensuring that our technological advancements are accessible and beneficial to everyone. Additionally, I enjoy playing soccer almost every week and cherish spending time with family and friends. Long drives with loved ones provide me peace and mental refreshment. Hiking and camping are also top activities I enjoy. If you're planning a camping or hiking trip, count me inâ€”I'm always ready for an adventure!
